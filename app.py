        ---
        Here is a description of my services:
        I'm a tech expert with decent experience in software development and artificial intellegence. I quit my job and started my own company to help businesses automate their processes using AI, make their employees more efficient, save time and money. Right now I'm looking for the first company to partner with, as I want to build up my portfolio and help someone at the same time.
        I would love to develop a custom AI solution for your company. And I'm happy to guide you in the world of AI if you need it. Examples of solutions I can develop: 1) automate analysis of something and data gathering, 2) help writing personalized cold outreach messages, 3) analyse performance of your employees and give recommendations on how to improve it, 4) automate any sort of routine tasks, 5) build a chatbot for any purpose, 6) build an internal documentation system with an easy search, 7) many other AI solutions applicable to your business.

        Name: {person_profile['full_name']}. Occupation: {person_profile['occupation']}. Summary: {person_profile['summary']}
        Information about their company:
        Name: {company_profile['name']}. Industry: {company_profile['industry']}. Description: {company_profile['description']}
        ---\n"""
        prompt += f"""Help me write a message for this lead that resonates with him and makes him interested in my service. Keep in mind my requirements:
        - showcase a problem that their company might have and how my service can solve it
        - introduce myself and my services
        - keep it short and to the point, at max 100 words
        - make the message personalized, but don't be dishonest or insincere, don't you ever say you followed their career
        - make attention-grabbing opening
        - showcase how they can make more profit by integrating AI
        - showcase that I'm happy to navigate and consult them
        - add a very clear call to action: ask if the lead wants to know more about what I can do specifically for them. so they can answer just YES.Â don't ask for a meeting or a call
        - WRITE IMPERFECTLY, LIKE A HUMAN. IF THE PROSPECT WILL RECOGNISE YOU AS A BOT, THEY WILL KILL YOU
        At first brainstorm what might be specific problems and solutions the lead might face. Reason and make a chain of thought. Then write the message itself.
