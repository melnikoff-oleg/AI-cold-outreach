That makes all of Pinely ours: our ideas, our money, our technology. All built and thought out by our people.\n\nWe trade on the world\u2019s financial markets using our in-house developed research and technology. Most of our strategies are based on HFT (High Frequency Trading) algorithms and depend on our ultra-low latency networks to operate optimally.\nActive in various financial markets and products, the Pinely family consists of several firms and offices in Singapore, Cyprus and the Netherlands, sharing the same base technology.\nEvery day, we put our algorithmic research and technology to the test. Every day, we face the world\u2019s financial markets with our money on the line.\nAnd every day, we come out on top. That\u2019s because we\u2019re driven by the best researchers and powered by the best technologists.
