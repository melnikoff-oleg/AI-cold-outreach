I want to reach out to a great candidate for our open position, to start a conversation and make the lead interested in the offered position.\nHere is more information about our company and open position:\nCompany: Jane Street. Position: Quantitative Researcher, Trading and Research. Location: London. Description: At Jane Street, we consider trading and programming to be two ends of a continuum. As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our software engineers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.\nResearchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of trading and software engineering roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.\nRequirements:\nBe able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.\nWrite great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it.\nHave good taste in research. The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose\nThink and communicate precisely and openly.
