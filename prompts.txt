Description: {company_profile['description']}

My objective and requirements for this cold outreach:
I'm an agency owner, we specialize in providing AI automations for businesses. I just want to start a conversation, not trying to get a meeting or to sell something immeditately.
I want to spark a conversation about their company and the potential upside of using AI in their business. Because nowadays many people understand that AI might benefit their business hugely.
Right now we're focused on reaching out financial companies, here is the list of potential AI solutions for them:
1. Analysing the data from selected sources on the internet fast (like twitter, news outlets, â€¦) in relations to specific assets
2. Due diligence: analysing specific company documents and making a standartized overview, when considering to invest in
3. Real-time monitoring the yield of different assets and providing suggestions on where to shift the liquidity
4. AI multi-agents to automate any part of the employee's pipeline
5. Regulatory reporting - AI can gather a report and your employee will only need to review it
6. Client relations and investor updates - investor can receive auto generated reports
7. Automated pitch-decks screening and evaluation for VC funds
How to write the message:
- It's a LinkedIn message, so include Subject and Body.
- GENERATE 1 FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE AS WELL.
- Keep messages short and to the point, ideally not more than 100 words.
- Make an attention-grabbing opening, so the lead can't help but read it.
- USE THE MOST SIMPLE ENGLISH WORDS.
- WRITE SIMPLE, SHORT SENTENCES.
- USE EXECATLY THE STYLE THAT I PROVIDED IN THE EXAMPLES.
- MAKE THE MESSAGE LOOK A BIT WEIRD. IMPERFECT.
- BE ULTRA SPECIFIC IN EVERY SENTENCE, AVOID VAGUE WORDS OR IDEAS. AI IS A VERY VAGUE CONCEPT, BE SPECIFIC.
- USE LOWERCASE LETTERS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT FOR NAMES.

Example messages:

Example 1

Subject: how can AI help SoundCapital make more money?

Body: hi Jacob, you seem to be an experienced hedge fund manager, have your team tried to use AI to optimize the process of company's docs review? when considering a potential investment.
I'm curious and open to talk to about potential business optimizations using AI, using multi-agents to automate a part of the employee's work, automated regulatory reporting, and many more, I think you know better.

Follow-up: or did you find AI to be worthless and you're happy to run the operations without it?

Example 2

Subject: smart VC funds use AI in their day-to-day

Body: hi Mason, I appreciate you path as a venture capitalist, do you know by any chance how VCs can become more efficient using AI?
one of the ideas that came to my mind: automated pitch-decks screening and evaluation. AI can do that pretty well, using both text and vision.
I'm just curious and looking for people eager to optimize their business with AI.

Follow-up: Mason, don't you want to make your employees more efficient using AI?

Example 3

Subject: fire your employees if they don't use AI at least 20% of their time

Body: hi Bill, you have an impressive trading background, are your employees aware about the latest AI and how they can optimize their work?
if your emoloyee manages a portfolio, they can use a custom tailored AI to analyse the relevant data 3x faster.
everyone can use ChatGPT from OpenAI's website, but that just a surface level thing and to optimize operations big time the approach has to be deeper.

Follow-up: hope you're doing awesome, Bill. so what do you think? AI is going exponentially further while the majority pretends like nothing happens.

Company: Jane Street. Position: Quantitative Researcher, Trading and Research. Location: London. Description: At Jane Street, we consider trading and programming to be two ends of a continuum. As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our software engineers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.
Researchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software engineering roles, this work involves many things: analysing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.
Requirements
Be able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.
Write great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it.

Think and communicate precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm
